# ELEVEN MEN MORRIS GAME
Eleven Men's Morris is a strategic board game for two players, similar to Nine Men's Morris but with eleven pieces per player. Players aim to form mills, which are three of their pieces aligned on consecutive points, to remove opponents' pieces. A player wins by reducing their opponent to two pieces or leaving them with no legal moves. The game consists of three phases: placing pieces, moving pieces to adjacent points, and flying when reduced to three pieces.

## Rules:
- **Phase 1 (Placing pieces):** Players take turns placing pieces on vacant points, aiming to form mills (three aligned pieces) and remove opponents' pieces. 
- **Phase 2 (Moving pieces):** Players move pieces to adjacent points, continuing to form mills and remove the opponent's pieces. 
- **Phase 3 (Flying):** When reduced to three pieces, players can move pieces to any vacant point on the board, there is no longer a limitation on that player of moving to only adjacent points

** Eleven Men's Morris is one of the best brain-teasing strategy games, and this project marks my first venture into transforming theoretical skills into a practical, enjoyable experience, blending learning with fun.
